# Frontend — Next.js + Tailwind

This folder contains the Next.js TypeScript frontend.

Quick setup:

```cmd
cd frontend
npm install
# copy .env.example to .env.local and update NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL if needed
npm run dev
```

Stack: Next.js (TypeScript), Tailwind CSS, Axios for API calls, React Hook Form (to be added), state management (Zustand or Context - to be chosen).

I can scaffold pages and components for Services, Staff, Customers, Appointments, Billing and Reports next. Reply "continue backend" or "continue frontend" to pick a module to implement first.
